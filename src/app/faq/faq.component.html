          <div class="collapse answer" id="collapse1">
            <p>LNG is an acronym for liquefied natural gas.</p>
            <p>In short, LNG is natural gas cooled to -162 degrees Celsius which condenses it into a liquid form. After it has been liquefied, it takes up much less space â€“ approximately 1/600th less than it would in its natural form. This makes it easier and safer to transport.</p>
            <p>Once condensed, LNG can be loaded on to cargo ships built for overseas transport. After reaching its end destination, it is re-converted to natural gas and processed for market use.</p>
